# Stepper Motor Sequencer for the AVR Microcontroller

*Jo-ha-kyū (序破急) is a concept of modulation and movement applied in a wide variety of traditional Japanese arts.
Roughly translated to "beginning, break, rapid", it essentially means that all actions or efforts should begin slowly, speed up,
and then end swiftly.*

An experimental stepper motor sequencer.
The sequencer would receive commands indicating the required start and end positions and maximum speed.
Sequences are created which move the stepper using smooth sine wave transitions, with the exact steps and timing required.

The sequencer uses the common DRV8825 stepper motor driver.
